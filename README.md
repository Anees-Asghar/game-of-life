# game-of-life
Conway's game of life implementation in Python.

---

## Setup and Usage
- Fork and clone this repo to your desktop
- On a terminal window navigate to the root directory and run

      python main.py <filename>

  if you intend to run the game of life loading the initial state from a file present in the saved-states folder or just
  
        python main.py
        
  if you want to run the game of life with a random 20 x 20 board as initial state.
	
## Things to note
- Each time the program is run using a random initial board state, the board state will be saved in the saved-states folder as "last-random-board". If you want to preserve that state for future use, rename it.
